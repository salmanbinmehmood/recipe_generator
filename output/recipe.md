## Simple & Delicious Caprese Pasta with Garlic-Infused Olive Oil

This recipe takes the classic flavors of a Caprese salad - juicy tomatoes, fresh basil, creamy mozzarella - and transforms them into a comforting and satisfying pasta dish. The garlic-infused olive oil adds a layer of savory depth that elevates the simple ingredients.

**Yields:** 4 servings
**Prep time:** 15 minutes
**Cook time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*   **Pasta:**
    *   1 pound pasta (penne, fusilli, or rigatoni work well)
    *   Salt, for pasta water
*   **Garlic-Infused Olive Oil:**
    *   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
    *   2 cloves garlic, minced
    *   Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)
*   **Tomato Sauce:**
    *   1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved (or 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes)
    *   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
*   **Assembly:**
    *   8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into bite-sized pieces
    *   1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
    *   Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)

**Instructions:**

**1. Prepare the Garlic-Infused Olive Oil:**

*   In a small saucepan, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using).
*   Heat over low heat for 5-7 minutes, being careful not to burn the garlic. You want the garlic to gently sizzle and infuse the oil with its flavor. The oil should smell fragrant.
*   Remove from heat and set aside.

**2. Cook the Pasta:**

*   Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.
*   Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente.
*   Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

**3. Prepare the Tomato Sauce (if using fresh cherry tomatoes):**

*   While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat.
*   Add 2 tablespoons of the garlic-infused olive oil to the skillet.
*   Add the halved cherry tomatoes to the skillet and season with salt and pepper.
*   Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes begin to soften and release their juices, about 8-10 minutes. Gently press down on some of the tomatoes with the back of a spoon to release more of their liquid.
*   Reduce heat to low and simmer until the pasta is ready.

**3. (Alternative) Prepare the Tomato Sauce (if using canned crushed tomatoes):**

*   While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat.
*   Add 2 tablespoons of the garlic-infused olive oil to the skillet.
*   Add the crushed tomatoes to the skillet and season with salt and pepper.
*   Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the pasta is ready, about 10 minutes.

**4. Combine the Pasta and Sauce:**

*   Drain the pasta and add it to the skillet with the tomato sauce.
*   Toss to coat the pasta evenly.
*   If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until it reaches your desired consistency.

**5. Add the Mozzarella and Basil:**

*   Remove the skillet from the heat.
*   Gently stir in the mozzarella pieces and chopped basil. The residual heat will melt the mozzarella slightly, creating a creamy sauce.

**6. Serve:**

*   Serve immediately, drizzled with the remaining garlic-infused olive oil.
*   Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.

**Serving Tips:**

*   **For a richer flavor:** Add a tablespoon of tomato paste to the tomato sauce while it's simmering.
*   **Add some protein:** Grilled chicken or shrimp would be a delicious addition to this pasta dish.
*   **Spice it up:** Use more red pepper flakes in the garlic-infused olive oil or add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the tomato sauce.
*   **Make it vegetarian:** This recipe is already vegetarian-friendly!
*   **Pairing:** This pasta dish pairs well with a crisp white wine, such as Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc.
*   **Garnish:**  A sprinkle of balsamic glaze adds a touch of sweetness and acidity that complements the other flavors.
*   **Leftovers:**  Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.  The mozzarella may become slightly less creamy upon reheating, but the flavor will still be delicious.
*   **Freshness is Key:** Use the freshest ingredients possible, especially the basil and mozzarella, for the best flavor.
